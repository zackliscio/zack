Hi, I'm Zack
Half coder, half poet
Whole human slinging rhyme schemes 
and venture capital pitches, 
ditching distant capital cities
staying up too late
doubling the candle's burn rate
while trying to keep the ends from meeting.

That's the crux of the issue, right?
Limited rotations around this earth,
only so many sets of ten thousand hours
to spend becoming an expert
scared of ending up a dilettante of worse,
too many changes of course 
might mean missing dessert.

Am I the sum of all my work? 

I'm feeling tied down by this cash purse
wondering how much is this net worth
if the things that slip out
are the ones I should have put first.
