Hi, I'm Zack
Half coder, half poet
Whole human slinging rhyme schemes 
and venture capital pitches, 
ditching distant capital cities
staying up too late
doubling the candle's burn rate
while trying to keep the ends from meeting.

There's never nearly enough time
to do all the things I want to do
as well as they deserve doing.

But that's the crux of the issue, right?
Limited rotations around this earth,
only so many sets of ten thousand hours
to spend becoming an expert
scared of ending up a dilettante or worse,
too many changes of course 
might mean missing dessert.

Am I just the sum of my life's work? 

I'm feeling tied down by this cash purse
wondering how much is this net worth
if the things that slip out
are the ones I should put first.

But on the flip side of this verse
I've stayed true to my adverse reaction 
to suit jackets and starched shirts

Even when it hurt I've been honest with myself
willing to return the hats that don't fit to the shelf
to reforge my best self 
from the alloys of my meltdowns

Like walking away from a good job
with a degree in English and no answer
to what are you going to do with that
after too many night shifts working retail
cold nights unloading box trucks
in the wake of 2008 and too big to fail
